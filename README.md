# Lepidoptery

Your sonic butterfly collection.

Lepidoptery is a script for Norns, and requires a Grid, and some way of inputting sound into the Norns.

Make some sounds. Use the grid to pin down the sound at any given moment. Your butterflies are well-organized, of course. Each row has a particular color, with the higher frequencies toward the top of the grid, and the lower toward the bottom, and each column has a particular shape, going from long butterflies on the left to very short butterflies on the right. The butterflies in the middle are a bit more fluttery.

As you are the lepidopterist, you can reorganize your butterfly collection in the params, deciding exactly what color each row should be, or exactly what shape each column should be.

K2 allows removing butterflies.
K3 + a butterfly + and empty space allows copying the pattern of the butterfly to a different shape and color.
K3 + a butterfly + E3 adjusts the volume of the butterfly.
